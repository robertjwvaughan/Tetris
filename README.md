# Tetris
The following is a submission for the second OOP assignment

# Concept
Towards the end of the first semester of the 2016/2017 academic year to design a game. I (Robert) began to ponder as to what would be a perfect game to highlight OOP concepts learned in the first half of the year long OOP module. I felt that the game should not only complex task to design but also something I had a passion in. After some time, I came to the conclusion that Tetris would be the perfect candidate.

# Why
Tetris is a tile-matching puzzle video game and was the first entertainment software exported from the USSR. When Tetris finally made its way to the Nintendo Entertainment System, the game became apart of a elite grouping of games that created interest in the video-game market across worldwide territories. The games simplistic yet restrictive rules create memorable enjoyment for a majority of players thus became a classic. I believed trying to recreate such a classic would be a interesting challenge to understake.
